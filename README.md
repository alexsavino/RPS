Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex Savino, a recent Astrophysics graduate from Columbia University.

This repository contains a personal project I developed shortly after finishing my undergraduate studies. Itâ€™s a Rock-Paper-Scissors app using Swift and Xcode, where a user can play against a computer. The app constantly displays three cards, and the user clicks on one to make a choice. The computer randomly selects its move, and the winner is shown. Itâ€™s designed for iOS, supporting both portrait and landscape modes. The game is automatically reset after every turn.

I aimed to emulate the animation style and pace of Duolingo.

Below is a GIF showing a single round of the game.
